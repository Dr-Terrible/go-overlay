	<longdescription lang="en">
		Motion is a tool that was designed to work with editors. It is providing
		contextual information for a given offset(option) from a file or directory
		of files.
		
		Editors can use these informations to implement navigation, text editing,
		etc... that are specific to a Go source code.

		It's optimized and created to work with vim-go, but it's designed to work
		with any editor. It's currently work in progress and open to change.
